FrontierVM 3 :D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This thing uses code from:

Reverse-engineered Atari ST frontier (David Braben, etc)
Hatari (http://hatari.sourceforge.net),
All the other shit i wrote myself (like the 68k assembler
and disassembler) are GPL (i guess...).

FrontVM3 blurb:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uses a very very experimental opengl renderer. Most primitives aren't
rendered yet so it isn't really playable.

Press CTRL-E to toggle between this and the original software renderer.


FrontVM2 addendum:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FrontVM2 has discarded the uae cpu core of hatari and instead compiles the
frontier 68k crap to native assembly language. This is done either by generating
a grotesquely huge C source file, or generating i386 asm directly.

If your computer is not i386 compatible, and you have loads of ram (it uses
2 or 3 hundred megs of ram compiling the huge generated C file with gcc-3.x)
then type:

$ make -f Makefile-C

Otherwise use the i386 one, which does not eat tons of ram, and generates
a smaller and faster binary:

$ make -f Makefile-i386

Some special keys:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


F11	- Toggle fullscreen.
Ctrl-E	- Toggle hardware GL / original software renderers.
Ctrl-M	- Toggle mouse grabbing.
Ctrl-Q	- Quit.
F	- Toggles some debug info & fps readout.

If you have a middle mouse button then pressing it should toggle
mouse grabbing also.

Changes
~~~~~~~

* 4096 colour palette (was 512 in ST version).

* dynamic colours are always allocated. frontier used to allocate 14
  dynamic colours for scenes which typically want 25-35 colours. now
  all these colours are available. this basically means frontier is
  now 256 colours from a 4096 colour palette.

* New option: Light/dark space colour.

* Fixed ST FE2 bug: milkyway was not visible until after a hyperspace.

* 'Scale2x' mode, which can be activated in the screen section of
  the big F12 menu thingy.

* ripped out the crappy sound code. sfx are now 8 or 16 bit 22khz
  wavs in sfx/, and music doesn't exist for the moment.

2004.05.16 - Option 'Icon beeps' had no effect in ST frontier. Fix this.
2004.05.16 - Remember option 'light/dark' space in savefiles.
2004.05.16 - Default to 'very high' detail level.


Savefiles should remain compatible with those of the atari ST version.
